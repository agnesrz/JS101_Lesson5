Lesson 5, Assignment 4, Example: I don't understand why forEach returns undefined
                                 and not [undefined, undefined]
    Update: I think I understand; here's the answer from the book:

    When determining the return values, it's important to understand how the method used in the example works.
    In this case, we're using forEach on the outside, which ignores the return value of the callback.
    Thus, we can see that the value of myArr is undefined.
